        <h1>Exercises for Shoulder</h1>
        <p>The way lifters train their shoulders is usually a balance of personal taste and injury history. Is
            putting heavy weight overhead the ultimate goal? Or does it make you wince just thinking about it? Are
            raises your bread and butter, or are they a low-priority accessory lift?
            <br>

            If you've read the other articles in the 10 Best series, you know we favor a little of both: a heavy
            muscle-building move like a press to start, followed by targeted isolation work after. This approach is
            a time-tested way to build the best shoulder workouts for both men and women. And it allows you to
            utilize a wide range of movements! Here's how we selected ours:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ease of learning and performing</li>
            <li>Total muscle stimulation and intensity</li>
            <li>Popularity among diehard lifters and bodybuilders (This matters!)</li>
            <li>Availability of equipment in commercial gyms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You'll find enough variations of each movement below to keep you busy for a long time. Read up, eat to
            grow, then get to work with the three complete workouts below!</p>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/bb_push_press-700xh.gif" alt="Reload page">
        <strong>Push-Press Variations for Shoulder Development:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Barbell push-press</li>
            <li>Dumbbell clean and push-press</li>
            <li>Kettlebell push-press (double-arm or single-arm)</li>
            <li>Front squat push-press</li>
            <li>Dumbbell thruster</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout: </strong> This doesn't need to be an "every workout" move. When you do use it,
            perform it first in
            your workout, after warming up well, for 3-4 sets of 6-8 reps. Stop each set before fatigue causes your
            form to crack.</p>
        <h3>Rear Delt Row</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/dumbbell_rear_delt_row-700xh.gif" alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> What the heck is a row doing in an article about shoulder
            exercises? Remember,
            rowing movements don't just work the "back," they involve the rear delts to a significant degree, as
            well. And experts like physical therapist John Rusin, creator of the BodyFit resource Unstoppable: The
            Ultimate Guide to Training Through Injury, believe that a key to shoulder health is rowing twice or even
            three times as much as you press. <br>

            One more point in favor of rows, particularly on an incline bench: a 2014 study found that in addition
            to hitting the rear delts as well as flyes, they activated the middle delt significantly better than
            dumbbell shoulder presses, cable lateral raises, and even barbell upright rows. This makes it a
            no-brainer for creating a time-efficient shoulder workout.

        </p>
        <strong>Rear Delt Row Variations for Shoulder Development:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Incline dumbbell row</li>
            <li>Bent-over dumbbell rear delt row</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> As part of a shoulder workout, do this immediately after press
            variations for sets of 8-10, or as a final high-rep movement for sets of 10-12 or more.</p>
        <h3>Seated Barbell Press</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/seated_bb_shoulder_press-700xh.gif" alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> Using a barbell rather than dumbbells may seem like a matter of
            taste, but there
            are functional reasons to pick the big bar. For one, you can put a bench in a rack and press off of the
            safety pins, allowing you to dial in your desired range of motion. Doing barbell-style presses on a
            Smith machine also allows you to safely push a bit closer to failure than other press variations and
            really focus on performing slow negatives.</p>
        <strong>Seated Barbell Press Variations for Shoulder Development:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Seated military press</li>
            <li>Smith machine shoulder press</li>
            <li>Smith machine behind-the-neck press (if your shoulders can tolerate it)</li>
            <li>Machine shoulder press</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> Do these first in your workout and use challenging weights for sets of
            6-8 reps. That's
            how bodybuilder Lawrence Ballenger starts his Boulder Shoulder workout before moving on to lighter
            lifts.</p>
        <h3>Arnold Press</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/arnold_press_1-700xh.gif" alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> Yes, this is just a dumbbell press with some rotation added in.
            Why give it a
            separate callout? Because the namesake of the move was definitely onto something!
            <br>

            Research has shown that the staple move of old-school muscle-building programs like the Blueprint to
            Mass hits both the front and medial delts more than other dumbbell press variations. Plus, many lifters
            simply find it more friendly to their shoulder joints. That's a big one-two punch.
        </p>
        <strong>Arnold Press Variations for Shoulder Development:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Seated Arnold press</li>
            <li>Standing Arnold press</li>
            <li>Standing single-leg Arnold press</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> These are great first in your workout, or second after a more basic
            overhead press.
            Consider pyramiding up in weight and down in reps for 4 sets of 12, 10, 8, and 6, like in the 3-Move
            Shoulder Builder workout.</p>
        <h3>Lateral Raise</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/lateral-raise-header-830x467.jpg" alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> This is one of the most popular and best isolation exercises in
            the weight room,
            but it's tougher to master than it seems. Beginners usually benefit from two cues: lead with your
            elbows, and only go down until your arms are about 30 degrees out from your sides. Both will help your
            raises be betterâ€”and more difficult.</p>
        <strong>Lateral Raise Variations for Shoulder Development:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Dumbbell lateral raise (double-arm and single-arm)</li>
            <li>Leaning cable lateral raise</li>
            <li>Cable lateral raise</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> If you really want to bring up your medial delts, use do this exercise
            first; if your
            front or rear delts need more work, do this exercise last. In either case, do it for at least 8-10 reps
            per set. Every once in a while, maybe after a scoop of your favorite pre-workout, take this to the next
            level by running the rack.</p>
        <h3>Front Raise</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/front-dumbbell-raise-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list: </strong> The "why" of this move is simple enough: raising your straight
            arm directly in
            front of you activates the anterior head of your deltoids. But it's not a must-do for everyone! Presses
            hammer the anterior delts, and these muscles already tend to be disproportionately large among
            individuals who overdo chest training compared to back training. <br>

            So, if you're only going to do one variation, which one is best? Single-sided dumbbell or cable raises
            are great because each side works independently, or alternating. This maximizes the mind-muscle
            connection, but also helps to build balanced shoulders.</p>
        <strong>Front Raise Variations for Shoulder Development:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Barbell front raise</li>
            <li>Alternating dumbbell front raise</li>
            <li>Single-arm cable front raise</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> If you're going to do it, do it in the second half of your shoulder
            workout. It's a
            great last movement for a burnout, especially superset with lateral raises, as in Abel Albonetti's
            Brutal Mass-Building Shoulder Workout.</p>
