        <h1> Exercises for arms</h1>
        <p>Over the years, a number of studies have sought to investigate the best biceps exercises. This shouldn't
            surprise you! You know the first thing you'd do if you ever got access to an EMG machine would be to
            hook it up to your guns. Be honest.
            <br>
            So, what's the winner? Based on biceps EMG alone, it's usually the concentration curl, a staple in the
            bodybuilding regimens of golden-era lifters like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno. But here's the
            catch: We've never met a single bodybuilder who whole-heartedly agreed.
            <br>
            Why not? For one, experienced lifters know that while muscle activation matters, it isn't the only thing
            that determines the best muscle-building exercises. Instead, we used a number of parameters to choose
            the 10 best, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ease of learning and performing</li>
            <li>Total muscle stimulation and intensity</li>
            <li>Popularity among diehard lifters and bodybuilders (This matters!)</li>
            <li>Availability of equipment in commercial gyms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You don't have to consider this a definitive list. Take it as the start of the discussion, then go
            experiment for yourself in the following three complete workouts!</p>
        <h3>Barbell Or EZ-Bar Curl</h3><img
            src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/ez_bar_curl_12-5fps-700xh.gif" alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list: </strong> The standard shoulder-width curl engages the short and long heads
            of the biceps
            equally, you can alter grip width to slightly change the emphasis (wide to target the short head, narrow
            for the long head), you can really pile on the weight, and you don't have to sit there endlessly working
            one arm at a time.
            <br>
            How many more reasons do you need? If you're only going to do one biceps exercise, make it this one.
            <br>
            Want to use a straight bar instead of a cambered EZ-bar? Have at it, if your wrists don't mind. A 2018
            study found that while both variants produced greater activity than dumbbell curls, "The small
            difference between [barbell] and EZ variants… makes the choice between these two exercises a matter of
            subjective comfort."

        </p>
        <strong>Barbell Curl Variations for Biceps Growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Standing Barbell curl (standard, close grip, wide grip)</li>
            <li>Standing EZ-bar curl (standard, close grip, wide grip)
            </li>
            <li>Seated barbell curl (emphasizing top half of range of motion)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> Hit your heavy curls at the beginning of your biceps workout when you
            can really
            challenge yourself with weight. For a bit more of a strength stimulus, choose a weight you can handle
            for about 6-8 reps, or even a classic size-and-strength rep range like 5x5. A common biceps blunder is
            rocking your body excessively on this movement. Keep it strict for the most part, especially when you're
            going heavy.</p>
        <h3>Dumbbell Curl</h3><img
            src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/best_damn_arm_workout_jeremy_dutra_12.5fps_v2-700xh.gif"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list: </strong> Is this really any different than a barbell curl? That's up to
            you. Sure, you can
            do the moves in basically the same way in the same workout, but we don't recommend it. The real value of
            dumbbell curls is that they can be done a number of ways: standing or seated, with both arms or
            alternating, rotating your wrists into Zottman curls to work on your fearsome forearms, or twisting that
            pinky up to focus purely on the bis. In short, you have options.</p>
        <strong>Dumbbell Curl Variations for Biceps Growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Standing dumbbell curl (bilateral, alternating)
            </li>
            <li>Seated dumbbell curl (bilateral, alternating)
            </li>
            <li>Zottman curl</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> If you're doing these after barbell or cable curls, emphasize the
            difference by
            performing Zottmans, or take bilateral seated curls to fatigue and then extend the set by switching to
            unilateral curls. <br>

            If you feel your reps getting sloppy, really hammer the negatives. It's been shown that the
            eccentric-focused reps can produce higher levels of force than the concentric, even when you're
            fatigued.</p>
        <h3>Reverse-Grip Barbell Row</h3><img
            src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/reverse-grip_barbell_row_12-5fps-700xh.gif"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> Some lifters speak reverently of the bent-over row as the "fourth
            powerlift."
            Whether you agree or not, this is a back-focused movement in which you can go very heavy, and with the
            reverse grip, the biceps are heavily engaged. It's not really the kind of exercise you'd do on a
            biceps-only day, so it makes a good bridge between back and biceps</p>
        <strong>Row Variations for Biceps Growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Reverse-grip bent-over row</li>
            <li>Cable seated row (underhand grip)</li>
            <li>Incline dumbbell row (underhand grip)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> Include it in your back routine, or as a bridge exercise when training
            back and biceps
            together. Go fairly heavy and train in the classic muscle-building rep range of 8-12 reps.</p>
        <h3>Hammer Curl</h3><img
            src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/rope-hammer-curl-header-830x467.jpg" alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> Curls with a palms-facing or neutral grip do more than just hit
            the biceps, they
            also heavily recruit the brachialis, a muscle that doesn't get measured on EMG studies because it's
            beneath the biceps. Because it's not as obvious a move as, say, a barbell curl, it often gets
            undeservedly skipped on arm day. <br>

            Why should you care? Increasing the girth of the brachialis can "raise" your biceps from below, making
            your entire arm larger. Another reason: They were Chris Hemsworth's go-to curl to transform into Thor.
            <br>
            Pro tip: The dumbbell version is solid, but even better is the cable version holding a rope grip,
            because it gives you constant tension throughout the range of motion.
        </p>
        <strong>Hammer Curl Variations for Biceps Growth</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Cable rope hammer curl</li>
            <li>Dumbbell hammer curl (bilateral, alternating, seated)</li>
            <li>Cable rope preacher hammer curl</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> Hammer curls are usually done in the middle or at the end of a workout
            in a classic rep
            range of 8-12 reps. Experiment with isometric holds to create a deep burn that even the pros fear.</p>
        <h3>Incline Curl</h3><img
            src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/incline-bench-curl-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it made the list:</strong> What's the difference between curling at 90 degrees and 45? More
            than you think.
            The incline curl elongates the biceps and increases the stretch at the start of the movement.
            Theoretically, this helps you target the long head and build the so-called "biceps peak."</p>
        <strong>Incline Curl Variations for Biceps Growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Incline dumbbell curl (bilateral, alternating)</li>
            <li>Palms-out incline curl</li>
            <li>Incline hammer curl</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> This is detail work, not the main course! Perform these after an
            exercise like standing
            curls, in which both biceps heads are targeted with heavy weight. Because of the "overstretched" arm
            position at the bottom of the movement, it's best done with relatively light weights and at least 8-12
            reps per set.</p>


        <h3>Preacher Curl</h3><img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/preacher-curl-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt="Reload page">

        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> There are many versions of the preacher curl, and every serious
            physique builder
            has their fave. Whatever version you do, you'll get a serious pump, particularly if you have a quality
            pre-workout or pump supplement coursing through your bloodstream at the time. In fact, this old-school
            peak-builder can be nearly enough for an entire biceps workout, perhaps with something like hammer curls
            added to it.
            <br>
            As with other movements that start from a stretched position, you get the most muscle activation during
            the lower third of the movement. As the weight moves up, the muscle doesn't have to work as hard. This
            is one reason the cable might be the best implement to use here to help complete your biceps.
        </p>
        <strong>Preacher Curl Variations for Biceps Growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Cable preacher curl (underhand, hammer)</li>
            <li>EZ-bar preacher curl</li>
            <li>Dumbbell preacher curl (bilateral, single-arm, hammer)</li>
            <li>Spider curl (dumbbell, EZ-bar)</li>
            <li>Machine preacher curl (bilateral, single-arm)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> Since your arms are against a bench, it's a very strict movement that
            doesn't allow a
            lot of cheating. Hence, this movement is best done toward the latter half of your workout for at least
            8-12 reps per set.

            Drag Curl</p>
        <h3>Bench Dip</h3><img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/bench-dip-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> Another dip? Yep. EMG evidence suggests that there's substantial
            triceps activation
            during a bench dip. How can you make this classic calisthenics move even better? By bumping up the load
            with added weight! <br>

            The best and safest way to load up is to have a partner place weights across your lap. Intensity
            boosters like dropsets are easy to do: just remove a plate to extend your set.</p>
        <strong>Bench Dip Variations for Triceps Growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Bench dip</li>
            <li>Weighted bench dip</li>
            <li>Feet-elevated bench dip</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> Put this in the middle or at the end of your workout, shooting for 3
            sets of 8-12 reps.
            If you are feeling super fatigued, this may not be the best exercise, since your shoulders could end up
            in a compromised position by rounding forward.</p>
        <h3>Cable Overhead Extension With Rope</h3><img
            src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/cable-overhead-triceps-ext-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> Like dumbbell overhead work, cable overhead presses focus on the
            often
            underdeveloped long head. The constant tension provided by the cable might actually make this a better
            choice than dumbbells if you're picking between the two.</p>
        <strong>Cable Overhead Extension Variations for Triceps Growth: </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Low cable overhead triceps extension</li>
            <li>High cable overhead triceps extension</li>
            <li>Single-arm low cable triceps extension </li>
            <li>Bodyweight triceps press</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout: </strong> This is a great second or third exercise in place of push-downs if you
            do 3 sets of 8-12 reps.</p>
        <h3>Single-Arm Cable Kick-Back</h3><img
            src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/cable-triceps-kickback-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> We're not big fans of the dumbbell kick-back because there are so
            many ways to
            cheat it and the angle of resistance is less effective than what you can achieve with a resistance band
            or cable. Surprisingly, one study by ACE fitness found that a well-executed kick-back can be as
            effective at activating the triceps as either dips or overhead extensions.
            <br>
            Just make sure you don't drop your elbow—a very common mistake, but one that's important enough to
            qualify for the "Laws of Triceps Training." Keep your upper arm parallel to the floor as you fully
            extend your elbow and squeeze. Don't use a handle here, just grab the rubber ball at the end of the
            cable. Alternately, you can use a resistance band.
        </p>
        <strong>Kick-Back Variations for Triceps Growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Single-arm cable kick-back</li>
            <li>Single-arm band kick-back </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout: </strong> Maximum contraction is key and you won't be able to go very heavy with
            this exercise, so
            place it last in your routine. Shoot for 3 sets of 10-12 reps. To optimize this cable kick-back for
            maximum muscle activation, take a bench and incline it up to about 60 degrees. Facing the weight stack
            with your chest on the bench, perform the cable kick-back with your upper arm locked parallel to the
            floor.</p>

        <h3>Cable Push-Down</h3><img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/cable_rope_push_down-700xh.gif"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> For many lifters, this is the quintessential triceps burnout move,
            and for good
            reason. It effectively targets the lateral head, is easy to perform—just don't let your arms drift from
            your sides!—and lends itself easily to dropsets.</p>
        <strong>Cable Push-Down Variations for Triceps Growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Cable V-bar push-down</li>
            <li>Cable straight-bar push-down</li>
            <li>Cable rope push-down</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> Since this is a single-joint or "isolation" exercise, do it toward the
            end of your
            workout for 3 sets of 10-12 reps or slightly higher.</p>
