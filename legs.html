        <h1>Exercises for Leg</h1>
        <p>With so many choices of how to train the lower body, it's no wonder that so many lifters feel overwhelmed
            and skip leg day entirely. (That's your excuse, right?) <br><br>

            This list will give you clarity, but you'll still have to work! Almost across the board, multijoint or
            "compound" exercises top this list. Why? In addition to recruiting more muscle mass, these exercises
            generate greater release of the muscle-building hormones testosterone and growth hormone. Here are the
            other standards we used to make our selections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ease of learning and performing</li>
            <li>Total muscle stimulation and intensity</li>
            <li>Popularity among diehard lifters and bodybuilders (This matters!)</li>
            <li>Availability of equipment in commercial gyms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Build around these movements, and you can create more efficient, effective leg workouts. And with three
            complete workouts we've included for you, you have no more excuses. Get educated and get to work!</p>
        <h3>Barbell Back Squat</h3><img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/barbell_squat-700xh.gif"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> Squats are king because they're the most challenging leg movement
            you can do. They
            work all the lower-body musculature and have been shown to spike muscle-building hormone release. In
            fact, squatting before doing curls has even been shown to significantly improve arm strength! Don't
            laugh: Powerlifter and bodybuilder Layne Norton, Ph.D., pairs the two moves in his Legs and Arms Blast
            workout. <br>

            High bar or low bar? That's up to you and your goals. High bar, where the bar rests atop the traps, hits
            all the leg musculature fairly evenly. Low bar, a favorite of powerlifters, targets the glutes and
            allows you to lift more weight. Not sure which? Choose the variation that allows you to squat deeper,
            more comfortably, and without excessively rounding your back.</p>
        <strong>Back Squat Variations for Leg Development:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Barbell back squat</li>
            <li>Barbell back squat to box</li>
            <li>Back squat with bands</li>
            <li>Back squat with chains</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> For leg growth, do this movement first with several light warm-up sets,
            pyramiding up in
            weight, before attempting your heaviest weight for multiple sets. Classic rep schemes like 5x5 or 3x8-10
            work great. Don't be afraid to belt up if you're going heavy. </p>
        <h3>Barbell Front Squat</h3><img
            src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/barbell-front-squat-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> Shifting the bar from the back to the front of the body changes
            your squat
            dramatically. Front squats emphasize the quads over the glutes and hams, which means you'll sacrifice
            some of the load. It also helps you maintain a more vertical torso position, which can help increase
            squat depth and perhaps decrease the risk of lower back injury.
            <br>
            Front squats also demand—and build—serious upper back and core strength. Those benefits also apply to
            variations like dumbbell front squats and goblet squats. Think you're too strong for goblets? Strength
            coach and physical therapist John Rusin requests that you do half your body weight for 20 reps and
            reconsider.

        </p>
        <strong>Front Squat Variations for Leg Development:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Barbell front squat</li>
            <li>Frankenstein squat</li>
            <li>Goblet squat</li>
            <li>Dumbbell front squat</li>
            <li>Kettlebell front squat (single, double)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In your workout: These are brutally hard, so do them first, when your energy levels are highest, for 3-4
            sets of 6-10 reps. Favor the lower end if you're looking to build strength. </p>
        <h3>Split Squat</h3><img
            src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/smith_single-leg_split_squat-700xh.gif"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> Done right, split squats—particularly rear-foot-elevated or
            "Bulgarian" split
            squats—are devastating to your legs. In fact, EMG evidence suggests that 4 sets using your 10-rep max
            with Bulgarians create similar quad activation to back squats. The same study also found similar
            testosterone responses between Bulgarians and back squats! <br>

            Nevertheless, split squats are deceptively difficult, partly because of balance and partly because
            you're training one side at a time. And when you raise your rear foot in a so-called Bulgarian split
            squat, everything gets tougher. If balance is holding you back, you can just drop your back foot, hold
            onto a stable object, or even perform them in the Smith machine.</p>
        <strong>Split Squat Variations for Leg Development:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Barbell Bulgarian split squat</li>
            <li>Dumbbell Bulgarian split squat</li>
            <li>Smith machine Bulgarian split squat </li>
            <li>Dumbbell split squat (rear foot down)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> These work best toward the middle of a leg session. Do 3-4 sets of 8-12
            reps per leg,
            and go for close to muscular failure on each set. If you really want to bring up the intensity, try
            bodyweight Bulgarians with blood flow restriction (BFR).

        </p>
        <h3>Hack Squat</h3><img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/hack-squat-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> A knock against machine-based leg exercises is that the hormone
            boost they generate
            just doesn't compare to free weights. But that's not a reason not to do them! It just means do them
            later in your leg workout when you're already fatigued. <br>

            One of the primary benefits of the hack squat is that you can manipulate foot placement, which is why
            fitness model Julian "The Quad Guy" Smith considers them one of his signature moves for legs. A high
            placement allows you to descend farther, which emphasizes the glutes and hamstrings. A lower placement
            means the quads take up a greater percentage of the workload.
            <br>
            It's also easier to use advanced intensity techniques like forced reps and dropsets, because you can
            change weight quickly and aren't balancing a barbell.
        </p>
        <strong>Hack Squat Variations for Leg Development:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Hack squat </li>
            <li>Single-leg hack squat
            </li>
            <li>Narrow-stance hack squat
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> Hack squats are typically done after free-weight exercises and before
            single-joint leg
            movements. The sweet spot is somewhere around 3 sets of 8-12 reps, although if you're following a
            program built by a hack devotee like Kris Gethin in his 8-Week Hardcore training plan, you can expect
            that to go up to 20-30 reps and beyond. Consider yourself warned!</p>
        <h3>Leg Press</h3><img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/leg-press-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p>Why it's on the list: Leg press vs. squat is a classic weight-room debate, but one that misses the point.
            Strength coach and physical therapist John Rusin explains why in his article, "Don't Do High-Rep Squats,
            Deads, and Bench! Do These Instead." Squats are for doing early in a leg workout and going heavy, he
            explains, and leg presses are for doing afterward for high reps. Sounds like a recipe for leg growth to
            us!
            <br>
            Like hack squats, the leg press allows for a variety of foot positions to target the outer quads, inner
            quads, glutes, or hamstrings. Just be careful not to lower the sled too far! This common mistake will
            lift your glutes up off the butt pad and cause your lower spine to curl. A rounded back puts you at risk
            for an injury.
        </p>
        <strong>Leg Press Variations for Leg Development:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Leg press </li>
            <li>Narrow-stance leg press</li>
            <li>Wide-stance leg press</li>
            <li>Single-leg leg press</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> You can't go wrong with 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps. Occasionally, when the
            pre-workout is
            flowing, do a few epic sets of 20-30 reps or more. This exercise also goes exceptionally well with
            intensity-boosting techniques such as rest-pause, dropsets, or forced reps.</p>
        <h3>Leg Curl</h3><img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/leg-curl-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p>Why it's on the list: What makes this single-joint machine move worthy of being listed among squats and
            deadlifts? Because too many lifters think those two exercises are "enough" for their hamstrings. They're
            definitely not! <br>

            In his article, "A Scientific Approach to Hamstring Training," muscle-building expert Brad Schoenfeld,
            Ph.D., conclusively makes the case that for balanced, strong hamstrings you need curls, too.
            Specifically, the lower hamstrings are activated dramatically more during seated leg curls than
            deadlifts—even stiff-legged deadlifts. <br>

            You wouldn't skip curls during an arm workout, would you? Don't make the same mistake for your legs.</p>
        <strong>Leg Curl Variations for Leg Development:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Seated leg curl</li>
            <li>Lying machine leg curl</li>
            <li>Lying cable leg curl</li>
            <li>Standing cable leg curl</li>
            <li>Exercise ball leg curl</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In your workout:</strong> Keep it simple: 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps, coming close to muscle failure.
            This is a
            low-risk, high-reward move, so occasionally add in some slow negatives or dropsets to make it more
            intense.</p>
