        <h1> Exercises For Back</h1>
        <p>When you crack your exercise toolkit open each week on back day, you've got a seemingly endless array of
            movements available. If you're overwhelmed by the sheer number of row variations, or you draw a total
            blank when thinking of new exercises to try, consider this list your new back blueprint. <br>

            We took the science into account--and more. Head-to-head exercise comparison research is a bit limited,
            and often misleading. So rather than going strictly off of electromyography (EMG) to pick the best
            muscle-building exercises, we selected the following ones on a number of factors including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ease of learning and performing</li>
            <li>Total muscle stimulation and intensity</li>
            <li>Popularity among diehard lifters and bodybuilders (This matters!)</li>
            <li>Availability of equipment in commercial gyms</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Here are the best back exercises for muscle growth, plus three complete back workouts incorporating the
            movements that you can plug into your split right away.</p>
        <h3>Deadlift</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/abel_30-day_deadlift_loop_700x394_12-5-700xh.gif"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p> <strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> This mighty pull is far more than a back exercise. It hits the
            entire posterior
            chain, from your calves to your upper traps, but it's also a time-tested standout for overall backside
            development. <br>

            And no, it's not just for powerlifters! Legendary bodybuilder Jay Cutler builds his back day around
            deadlifts, as well. Technique is uber-important, but once you nail it, you can progress to lifting
            monster weights that recruit maximum muscle, release muscle-building hormones, and help you get big.</p>
        <strong>Deadlift variations for back growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Barbell deadlift (from the floor)</li>
            <li>Barbell rack pull</li>
            <li>Romanian deadlift (barbell, dumbbell)</li>
            <li>Snatch-grip deadlift (from the floor or elevated pins)</li>
            <li>Trap bar deadlift</li>
        </ul>
        <p> When back development is the goal, stick to one of these variations. Others, like sumo deadlifts, have
            been shown in EMG studies—and in the trenches—to focus more on other muscle groups than the back. The
            same goes for single-leg deadlifts and stiff-legged deadlifts.
            <br>

            <strong>In your workout:</strong> If you're going heavy (sets of fewer than about 6 reps), do deadlifts
            first so you're
            fresh. If you're doing deads for repetitions, you can do them later in your workout. They may not be as
            sexy, but moderate-weight deadlifts are just as valuable as grinding max-effort PRs.
        </p>
        <h3>Bent-Over Row</h3><img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/bent-over-row-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p> <strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> This is a total back-builder: upper back, lower back, lats,
            traps,
            spinal
            erectors—the whole deal. And the science backs it up. It's a staple of the best back workouts for men,
            but make no mistake, it's great for back workouts for women, as well.</p>
        <strong>Bent-over row variations for back growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Overhand grip bent-over rows</li>
            <li>Underhand grip bent-over rows</li>
            <li>Pendlay rows (each rep starts from the floor)</li>
            <li>Bent-over dumbbell or kettlebell rows</li>

        </ul>
        <p> <strong>In your workout:</strong> Do heavy bent-over rows toward the start of your back workout in lower
            rep ranges, such
            as 6-8 or 8-10, in order to save your lower back. If you're wrecked from deadlifts, skip it or do it on
            a second back day later in the week.

        </p>


        <h3>Pull-Up</h3><img
            src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/cass_martin_pull-up_1_700x394_12-5-700xh.gif"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p> <strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> It's always a good idea to have an overhead pulling movement in
            your back routine,
            and the pull-up is one of the best. Each variation has its own advantages: Wide-grip variations are
            great for the upper lats, while close-grip chins or neutral-grip pull-ups have a greater stretch and
            overall range of motion. Mix it up!</p>
        <strong>Pull-up variations for back growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Wide-grip pull-ups (overhand grip)</li>
            <li>Chin-ups (underhand grip)</li>
            <li>Neutral grip pull-ups (palms facing inward)</li>
            <li>Behind-the-head pull-ups</li>
            <li>Pull-ups on gymnastic rings</li>
            <li>Weighted pull-ups or chins/li>
            <li>Machine-assisted pull-ups</li>
            <li>Machine-assisted pull-ups</li>
            <li>Spotter-assisted pull-ups</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Don't discount those last three! Especially for heavier lifters, assisted variations are great
            back-builders. Do what you need to do to get into a muscle-building rep range. <br><br>

            <strong>In your workout: </strong>
            If you're a pull-up pro, you can do some light sets as a warm-up. If they're tougher
            for you, you can treat them more as a strength movement toward the start of your workout. Assisted
            variations make for great burnouts at the end of a back workout.
        </p>

        <h3>T-Bar Row</h3><img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/t-bar-row-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p> <strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> The T-bar row may seem at first glance like another variation of
            the bent-over row,
            but serious lifters know there's a big difference. For one, you can pile on more weight. <br><br>

            You also typically have a choice of hand positions and width. A wider grip will put more emphasis on the
            lats, while a neutral grip will better target the middle back (rhomboids, teres, and traps).
        </p>
        <strong>T-bar row variations for back growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>T-bar row</li>
            <li>Lying T-bar row</li>
            <li>Landmine row holding a wide T-handle (overhand grip)</li>
            <li>Landmine row holding the bar</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>In your workout: </strong>
            Do this toward the front half of your workout, especially if you're going to go heavy.
            Because it's slightly easier on the lower back, you could do it after deadlifts, but stay mindful of
            using strict form. If you find yourself cheating or struggling to maintain a flat back, a
            chest-supported row may be a better choice.
        </p>


        <h3>Seated Row</h3><img
            src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/dylan_thomas_seated_wide-grip_row_2_700x394_12-5-700xh.gif"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> Unlike every free-weight variation here, the classic seated row
            maintains constant
            tension throughout every inch of the movement.
            <br><br>
            Plus, many gyms have a wide range of handles that you can clip onto a seated cable row with a carabiner,
            giving you all manner of wide and narrow grips and different hand positions.
        </p>
        <strong>Seated row variations for back growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Cable row (narrow, wide, medium, overhand, underhand, neutral grip)</li>
            <li>Single-arm cable row (seated, kneeling, half-kneeling)/li>
            <li>High-cable standing row</li>
            <li>Machine seated row</li>
            <li>Plate-loaded high row</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>In your workout: </strong> Like machines, cables can be loaded up pretty heavily without overly
            taxing you. These
            are best done toward the end of your workout, so don't be afraid to go slightly higher-rep here, like
            10-12 or even 12-15 reps.</p>
        <h3>Single-Arm Dumbbell Row</h3><img
            src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/cass_martin_single-arm_db_row_1_700x394_12-5-700xh.gif"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p> <strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> This is a classic unilateral exercise—meaning each side works
            independently. It's
            also one that allows you to move a lot of weight, particularly if you use straps. <br>
            You'll get a greater range of motion when training unilaterally, and you'll be better able to support
            your lower back by placing one hand on a bench. Allowing a slight degree of rotation of the trunk has
            been shown to activate a greater amount of "core" musculature, as well.</p>


        <strong>Single-arm dumbbell row variations for back growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Single-arm dumbbell row variations for back growth:</li>
            <li>Single-arm row with one hand and one leg on a bench</li>
            <li>Single-arm arc row, reaching forward at the front of each rep
            </li>
            <li>Single-arm barbell row (landmine to the rear)</li>
            <li>Single-arm "Meadows row" (landmine to the side)
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p> <strong>In your workout:</strong> This is a "meat and potatoes" back exercise. Do it in the middle or
            end
            of your workout for sets of 8-12 or higher.</p>
