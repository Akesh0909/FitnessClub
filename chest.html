        <h1> Exercises For Chest </h1>
        <p> Our choices are based on results in the lab, but also the weight room. Serious lifters know that
            measuring activation from electromyography (EMG) to pick the best muscle-building exercises is helpful,
            but far from perfect. So, we used a number of parameters, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ease of learning and performing</li>
            <li>Total muscle stimulation and intensity</li>
            <li>Popularity among diehard lifters and bodybuilders (This matters!)</li>
            <li>Availability of equipment in commercial gyms</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Here are the best chest exercises for muscle growth, plus three complete chest workouts to put those
            movements into action. Along with growth-focused nutrition and supplementation, this can be your action
            plan for a bigger chest!</p>
        <h3>Barbell Bench Press</h3>

        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/workouts/2017/10/narrowgripbenchpress-1509458862.gif" alt="Reload page">

        <p> <strong>Why it's on the list: </strong>It's popular to hate on the bench press these days, but it's one
            of the most
            popular lifts in the gym for a reason. For one, the standard barbell bench allows you to move the most
            weight. It's also an easier lift to control than pressing with heavy dumbbells. The exercise is also
            relatively easy to spotâ€”so don't be afraid to ask for one! <br>The bench press also responds well to
            classic protocols like 5x5 for muscle and strength, or even 10x10, aka German Volume Training, for pure
            mass. If you want to get serious, there are systematic bench press programs like Bench 300 to help you
            chase a big number.</p>

        <strong>Barbell Bench Press Variations for Chest Growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Barbell bench press (medium, wide, or close grip)</li>
            <li>Barbell floor press</li>
            <li>Barbell bench press with chains</li>
            <li>Bench press with a neutral grip, "Swiss bar," or multi-grip bar</li>
            <li>Reverse-grip barbell bench press</li>
            <li>Barbell "guillotine" bench press</li>
            <li>Bench press with suspended weights</li>
            <li>Reverse band bench press</li>
        </ul>

        <p> <strong>In your workout:</strong> Bench toward the start of your chest workout for heavy sets in
            lower
            rep ranges,
            such as
            5-8 reps. There are better moves for high-rep chest burnouts. Vary your grip width and style for
            more
            complete chest development.
        </p>
        <h3>Dumbbell Bench Press</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/dumbbell-bench-press-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt=" Reload page">

        <p> <strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> Whether dumbbell or barbell presses are better for growth is
            an
            age-old
            weight-room
            debate. Luckily, you can do both! But there's little doubt that the dumbbell variation has more
            versatility throughout the beginning, middle, and end of a chest workout. <br>Some other big plusses
            for
            dumbbells: Each side's musculature must work independently, creating more balanced strength and
            size.
            Dumbbells also allow a longer range of motion, which some studies say can lead to muscle growth.
            Plus,
            you
            can more easily tweak your grip to create variety and a new stimulus on chest day.
        </p>
        <strong>Dumbbell Bench Press Variations for Chest Growth: </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Dumbbell bench press</li>
            <li>Neutral-grip dumbbell bench press</li>
            <li>Close-grip dumbbell bench press</li>
            <li>Single-arm dumbbell bench press</li>
            <li>Alternating dumbbell bench press</li>
        </ul>

        <p> <strong>In your workout:</strong> At least some of the time, do flat dumbbell presses toward the
            start
            of your chest
            workout for heavy sets in lower rep ranges. They can also work well for high reps later in a chest
            workout, either flat or on an incline or decline. <br>

            <strong>Here's what not to do:</strong> A few sets of the barbell bench press, then the same sets
            and
            reps for
            dumbbell.
            The similar nature of these movements was confirmed via EMG analysis, which demonstrated no
            significant
            differences between flat-bench dumbbell and barbell presses in regard to muscle activation.

        </p>

        <h3> Push-Up</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/push-up-header-830x467.jpg" alt="Reload page">

        <p> <strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> An obvious point in favor of push-ups is that they require no
            equipment and
            can be
            the centerpiece of a home chest workout, like in strength coach Paul Carter's program Jacked at
            Home:
            Bodyweight Muscle-Building Workouts. But they're also highly versatile, easy to adjust for range of
            motion, and can help strategically target different parts of your chest with a few simple tweaks to
            elevation or hand . <br>

            "Yeah, but they're just push-ups," you say. "They're definitely not enough to make you strong."
            Believe
            it or not, an in-depth analysis found that push-ups and bench presses are similar in both muscle
            activation and overall muscle gains. This doesn't mean push-ups should be all you do, but it means
            they
            definitely should have a place in your repertoire.</p>

        <strong>Push-Up Variations for Chest Growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Push-up</li>
            <li>Feet-elevated push-up</li>
            <li>Hands-elevated push-up</li>
            <li>Suspended push-up</li>
            <li>Hand-release push-up</li>
            <li>Weighted push-up</li>
            <li>Banded push-up</li>
        </ul>

        <p> <strong>In your workout:</strong> Sets of push-ups to failure are a great way to burn out or add
            volume in the
            late
            stages of a workout, and they're awesome in a compound set with dips, a mechanical dropset after
            flyes or presses, or an antagonist chest-and-back superset with rows. Weighted push-ups and
            push-ups
            with resistance bands can even be a primary push movement, if needed.</p>


        <h3>Dumbbell Pull-Over</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/chest-dumbbell-pull-over-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt="Reload page">
        <p> <strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> Pull-overs have been a favorite torso builder of bodybuilders
            for
            decades. Dating
            back to the 1940s and earlier, lifters alternated them with 20-rep squats in workouts designed to
            expand
            the ribcage. The logic behind this approach may not stand up today, but the move is still worth
            including on a modern chest day. <br>

            Lean toward the incline version, which puts your chest fibers under tension for a longer range of
            motion. Use a bench that's 30-45 degrees and keep your elbows in a fixed comfortable angle. The more
            they bend and flex, the more this becomes a triceps movement</p>
        <strong>Pull-Over Variations for Chest Growth</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Incline straight-arm pull-over</li>
            <li>Pull-over to press</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>In your workout:</strong> Do pull-overs at the very end of your workout for sets of around 12
            reps. On every set,
            hold the peak contraction of the last rep for a full 5 seconds.</p>
        <h3>Machine Fly</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/march/machine-fly-header-830x467.jpg" alt="Reload page">
        <p> <strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> For the majority of lifters, the machine chest fly (aka,
            pec-deck)
            is a more
            effective, harder-to-screw-up alternative to dumbbell flyes. If your gym has one, it's a great move
            to
            get a great pump without having to balance any weights or put your shoulders at risk. <br>

            But does it work? EMG data shows that activation of the pectoralis major is statistically similar
            between the machine fly and bench press, which means that even though you'll likely be working in
            different rep ranges for each exercise, both are worthy components to chest day. The big difference?
            For
            the machine, you don't need a spotter and can more safely push the intensity and reach true muscle
            failure.
            <br>
            <strong> In your workout:</strong> As a pre-exhaust, hit a few sets of 10-15 before your presses.As
            a
            burnout, hit the
            machine fly last in your routine for sets of around 10-12. Experiment with dropsets, partial reps,
            and
            other intensity boosters. Don't be afraid to take this movement to failure, and know that you've
            earned
            your post-workout protein shake.
